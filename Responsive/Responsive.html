					And then this happened.

					I was not raised in a particularly religious household. Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.

					It's that we all have it within our power to make this a better world. Politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming. The question, now, is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build. This last point is important because there are some who advocate for democracy only when they are out of power; once in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others.

					Woohoo!

					Because the Iraq war is not just a security problem, it's a moral problem. Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company. That's not the judgment we need. But this much is clear: governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful and secure. We will open centers of scientific excellence in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and appoint new Science Envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources of energy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, and grow new crops.

					They know those things. But there's a story I want to share that takes place before Moses passed the mantle of leadership on to Joshua. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church? Yes. I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work. For we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country, prosperity is hurt everywhere.

					They know they have to work hard to get ahead - and they want to. But she didn't. I have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year.

					It's that we all have it within our power to make this a better world. That anger is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition, and prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. And throughout history, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality.

					I just think he doesn't know. She poured everything she had into me. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives. For peace to come, it is time for them - and all of us - to live up to our responsibilities.
