				Hello World, indeed! This may not be the first time code that I have written has appeared on the world wide web, but it is certainly the first code to appear for many years. Within various jobs and classes in college (that was so long ago - can I even remember that far back?) I dabbled in the vast Computer Science world, and am excited to jump back in!

				I stepped away from CompSci to focus on aspects of life that I considered far more important and useful at the time: Psychology, English, Running, Skiing, Drinking, Socializing, Cycling, Architecture, Interior Design, Crafting... the list goes on. It's safe to say that while all the above proved to be very fun, interesting, and great life experiences, it is time to focus on that one great and important aspect: My Career.

				Currently, I'm a customer care representative at a local SaaS start-up, and I think that both I and my company could benefit from increasing my technical knowledge. As a side-benefit, I am also hoping to be able to create some fancy website that wraps all my above-mentioned interests into a huge money-maker (I want it to be able to post pictures of my projects and adventures, share them with friends and then see what my friends are up to...). I'll have to put some more thought into that one.
